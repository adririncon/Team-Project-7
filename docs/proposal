The Movie Forecast:
  
  Our first proposal is a movie recommender application. We would use a movie database and the weather to recommend someone a movie. Users could put in
optional parameters such as keywords (for mood/genre), runtime, month, and if they want to watch a bad movie or not. The application would return a list of movies with those that
fulfill all the requirements boosted to the top. The goal would be to provide the user with a movie recommendation that matches the user's environment
and the other qualifications they are looking for.

Great American Playlist:

   Our second proposal generates a road trip route and a playlist for the road trip based on various locations the user wants to visit within the U.S. 
 We would use a navigation database and a spotify database. The app generates a playlist based on the amount of time the road trip takes and the states/locations it passes through. 
 We would satisfy the third party authentication through Spotify.
