Searching for a movie of a specific rating, runtime, genre
If my log in is succesful, I should be taken to the main page where there will be multiple filters where I can then input a specific rating, runtime or genre. I could 
then type in the specific runtime, which if it is not in an accepted format will give an error message. The genre and rating will be a dropdown which I could also 
click on. There will be a search button to be clicked once I have specified all the filters I want. Once it is clicked, all the searches will show up 
and categorized. If genre isn't specified, it will be specified based on the weather. I can then click on each one and read more about it.
