As a logged in user, I will be able to leave a ranking out of 100, depending on how much I liked the movie. This will better the movie ranking in the website, 
therefore making the movie more likely to be recommended to other users in the future. This will also provide the more interaction to the website,
providing feedback that can be used to better user experience. This can also help to compare with the rotten tomatoes rankings and show how the data is
compared between our users and theirs.
