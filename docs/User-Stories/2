No inputs, random recommendation based on weather
As a logged in user, I will be sent to the main page where all the options will be. Without having to click on anything, the website should automatically give a movie 
recommendation based on the weather of the location I am in. I should then be able to have the option of clicking on a  "Watch" button or ignore it and continue on
and be able to click on the other buttons/filters in the website.
